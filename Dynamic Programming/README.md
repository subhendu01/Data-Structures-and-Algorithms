# Dynamic Programming
#### Definition:
      Dynamic Programming(DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving an optimization problem by breaking it down into 
      simpler subproblems and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal 
      solution to the subproblems.
